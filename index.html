        <div class="feature-text">
          <h3>Connect and apply business rules to any data source</h3>
          <p>The platform can connect to cloud databases, web applications, import on-premises databases and files, and integrate with cloud storage. We apply your business rules to the data and present the results via data cubes, reports and dashboards.</p>
          <p>Without ReddReports, companies must either build custom data movement programs or export data manually to integrate these data sources. It is expensive and hard to integrate and maintain such systems. These systems also often lack the enterprise grade monitoring, alerting, and controls that a fully managed service can offer.</p>
