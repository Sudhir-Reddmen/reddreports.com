    <h1>Security Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>At ReddReports, we take privacy very seriously. We've updated our privacy policy (Policy) to ensure that we communicate to You, in the clearest way possible, how we treat personal information. We encourage You to read this Policy carefully. It will help You make informed decisions about sharing Your personal information with us.</p>
    <p>The defined terms in this Policy have the same meaning as in our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, which You should read together with this Policy. By accessing our Website and using our Service, You consent to the terms of this Policy and agree to be bound by it and our Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2>Protecting your data</h2>
    <p>We're committed to the security of our customers' data and provide multiple layers of protection for the personal and financial information you trust to ReddReports.</p>

    <h3>You control access</h3>
    <p>As a ReddReports customer you have the flexibility to invite unlimited users into your account to collaborate on your data, and the person that holds the subscription has control over who has access and what they are able to do. However, our technical staff have full access to your information in order to setup your information database, the data models, reports and dashboard.</p>

    <h3>User authentication</h3>
    <p>We provide secure access to the ReddReports software through a login and password.</p>

    <h3>Data encryption</h3>
    <p>We encrypt all data that goes between you and ReddReports using industry-standard TLS (Transport Layer Security), protecting your personal and financial data.</p>

    <h3>Network protection</h3>
    <p>ReddReports takes a "defense in depth" approach to protecting our systems and your data. Multiple layers of security controls protect access to and within our environment, including firewalls, intrusion protection systems and network segregation. ReddReports security services are configured, monitored and maintained according to industry best practice.</p>

    <h2>Always There</h2>
    <p>ReddReports is there when you need it, regardless of the day or time, or where you happen to be.</p>

    <h3>Best in class availability</h3>
    <p>With a record of 97% uptime, ReddReports delivers best-in-class availability. We use multiple redundancy technologies for our hardware, networks, data centres and infrastructure. These ensure that if any component fails, ReddReports will keep on running &ndash; with little or no disruption to your service.</p>

    <h3>Built to perform at scale</h3>
    <p>ReddReports has been designed to grow with your business. Our high performance servers, networks and infrastructure ensure we can deliver quality service to you and our hundreds of thousands of other users.</p>

    <h3>Disaster recovery and readiness</h3>
    <p>ReddReports performs real-time data replication between our geographically diverse, protected facilities, to ensure your data is available and safely stored. This means that should even an unlikely event occur, such as an entire hosting facility failure, we can switch over quickly to a backup site to keep ReddReports and your business running. We transmit data securely, across encrypted links.</p>

    <h3>Constant updates and innovation</h3>
    <p>We're constantly enhancing ReddReports, delivering new features and performance improvements. Updates are delivered frequently, with the majority of them being delivered without interrupting our service and disrupting users.</p>

    <h2>Your online safety</h2>
    <p>We design security into ReddReports from the ground up. However, there can be risks to working and playing online. Whether you're shopping, banking, doing your accounts, or simply checking your email, cyber criminals and scammers are always looking for ways to steal money or sensitive information. There are precautions you can take to reduce the risks and help keep you safe from harm online.</p>

    <h3>Phishing and malicious emails</h3>
    <p>A phishing email is a favoured way for cyber criminals to get access to your sensitive information, such as your usernames and passwords, credit card details, bank account numbers, etc. This kind of email may look as if it has come from a trustworthy source, but will attempt to trick you into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>clicking on a link that will infect your computer with malicious software</li>
      <li>following a link to a fake (but convincing looking) website that will steal your login details</li>
      <li>opening an attachment that will infect your computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you are hooked, the cyber criminal may be able to steal or extort money from you, or gather sensitive personal or business information that they can use for other attacks.</p>
    <p>However, you can protect yourself and your business by being aware of these scams, and by knowing what to look for that may help you identify a malicious email:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect spelling or grammar: legitimate organisations don't always get it 100% right, but be suspicious of emails with basic errors.</li>
      <li>The actual linked URL is different from the one displayed &ndash; hover your mouse over any links in an email (DON'T CLICK) to see if the actual URL is different.</li>
      <li>The email asks for personal information that they should already have, or information that isn't relevant to your business with them.</li>
      <li>The email calls for urgent action. For example, "Your bank account will be closed if you don't respond right away".</li>
      <li>The email says you've won a competition you didn't enter, have a parcel waiting that you didn't order, or promises huge rewards for your help.</li>
      <li>There are changes to how information is usually presented, for example an email is addressed to "Dear Sirs" or "Hello" instead of to you by name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Try to avoid a phishing attack by following these rules</h3>
    <p>If you receive a suspicious email make sure you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DO NOT CLICK on any link or attachment contained in the email.</li>
      <li>DO NOT REPLY to the email.</li>
      <li>Report the email by forwarding it to <a href="mailto:support@reddreports.com">support@reddreports.com</a> if it is ReddReports-branded.</li>
      <li>Delete the email.</li>
      <li>Update your anti-malware (anti-virus, anti-spyware) and run a full scan on your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This policy may be updated from time to time</h2>
    <p>ReddReports reserves the right to change this Policy at any time, and any amended Policy is effective upon posting to this Website. ReddReports will make every effort to communicate any significant changes to You via email or notification via the Service. Your continued use of the Service will be deemed acceptance of any amended Policy.</p>
